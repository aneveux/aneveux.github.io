# Hello!

After many attemps of me managing a technical blog, *(which all led to hours of selecting and customizing a blog, writing one or two articles, and forgetting about it)* I decided I wanted to try it again.

So here I am, with yet another fresh start, and the idea to write extremely simple and quick articles about things I use, like, or do. This blog is a technical one, so expect only articles about IT stuff. I'll probably start with some small articles about my development environment.

Thanks a lot for your interest, and let's see how it goes.
